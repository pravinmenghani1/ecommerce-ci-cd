# Docker Container E-Commerce Application CI/CD Pipeline

## What We'll Build Today

### Application
- Modern e-commerce web application
- Responsive design with product catalog
- Shopping cart and checkout functionality
- Containerized with Docker for consistency

### CI/CD Pipeline
- Automated build and deployment process
- GitHub integration for source control
- AWS CodeBuild for building Docker images
- AWS CodeDeploy for blue/green deployments
- Amazon ECS for container orchestration
- Amazon ECR for container registry

## Benefits of This Approach

### For Developers
- Consistent development environment
- Automated testing and deployment
- Focus on writing code, not managing infrastructure
- Immediate feedback on code quality

### For Operations
- Reliable, repeatable deployments
- Easy rollbacks if issues occur
- Infrastructure as code for version control
- Scalable and resilient architecture

### For Business
- Faster time to market for new features
- Improved application reliability
- Reduced operational overhead
- Better customer experience
